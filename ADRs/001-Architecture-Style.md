# 3-Tier Architecture for the Library Management System

## Context and Problem Statement
In order to design a scalable, maintainable, and flexible system for managing library operations, we need to select an appropriate architectural style. 
The system should allow us to separate concerns between the presentation tier, application tier, and data storage tier, while supporting ease of expansion for future features.


## Decision Drivers

* Scalability
* Maintainability
* Performance

## Considered Options

* Monolithic Architecture
* Microservices Architecture
* 3-Tier Architecture

## Decision Outcome

The architecture style we choose was 3-Tier Architecture because it provides a clear separation between the presentation tier, 
application tier, and data storage tier. This allows for easier scalability and maintence due to each tier being updated or scaled as needed without impacting the other tiers.
This architecture is simple to implement for the current scope of the project and will easily support future growth without significant rework.

### Consequences
#### Pros
* It allows for modularity and separation, making the system easier to maintain and scale.
* Each layer can be scaled independently based on performance needs.
* It provides a solid foundation for adding new features.

#### Cons
* Introducing clear boundaries between layers requires careful planning and communication between layers, which could increase the initial development time.
* Communication between layers may hinder performance, although this is generally minimal.

### Confirmation
The decision to use a 3-Tier architecture has been confirmed as the best choice based on current project requirements. 
With this we can monitor the system's performance and scalability.


## Pros and Cons of the Options
### Monolithic Architecture
#### Pros
* Simplicity: Monoliths are relatively straightforward to develop and deploy since all the code resides in one place.
  This simplicity can be advantageous for projects with limited complexity.
* Debugging: With all code located in one place, itâ€™s easier debug and find an issue.
#### Cons
* Deployment: A small change to a monolithic application requires the redeployment of the entire monolith.
* Scalability: As an application grows, monolithic architecture can become a bottleneck.
Scaling a monolith typically involves replicating the entire application, which can be inefficient and costly.
* Slower development speed: A large, monolithic application makes development more complex and slower.

###  Microservices Architecture
#### Pros
* Improved fault isolation: Larger applications can remain mostly unaffected by the failure of a single module.
* Smaller and faster deployments: Smaller codebases and scope mean quicker deployments.
* Scalability: Since your services are separate, you can more easily scale the most needed ones at the appropriate times,
  as opposed to the whole application.
#### Cons
* Communication between services is complex: Since everything is now an independent service, you have to carefully handle requests traveling between your modules.
* Debugging: Each service has its own set of logs to go through.
* Deployment challengers: The product may need coordination among multiple services.
